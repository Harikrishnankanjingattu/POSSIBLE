## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Sales & Lead Outreach Agent** is an intelligent, multilingual voice-automation system designed to improve lead engagement and conversion for businesses across sectors such as BFSI, EdTech, Healthcare, Retail, and Agri-Business.

The system replaces traditional scripted IVR and expensive human telecalling teams with an **emotion-aware, context-driven AI voice agent** capable of conducting natural conversations in multiple Indian languages.

## 🧠 Abstract

The AI Sales & Lead Outreach Agent is an intelligent, multilingual voice-automation system developed to enhance and scale lead engagement across diverse linguistic and demographic markets. Powered by the **Gemini API**, the system utilizes advanced speech recognition, natural language understanding, and real-time reasoning to autonomously conduct follow-up calls, qualify leads, and provide personalized information with human-like clarity and empathy.

The solution is optimized for India’s multilingual ecosystem, supporting regional languages, dialect variations, informal speech patterns, and code-mixed conversations commonly used by customers.

At the core of the interaction model is the **PESO framework**:

- **Pain** – Identifies customer problems  
- **Emotion** – Detects emotional cues such as interest, hesitation, or frustration  
- **Solution** – Offers relevant, context-aware explanations  
- **Offer** – Delivers persuasive and personalized offers  

This framework enables dynamic adjustment of tone and conversation strategy, resulting in improved trust and higher conversion rates compared to conventional automated systems.

The system integrates:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Sentiment and emotion detection
- Adaptive response generation
- Conversation fallback and recovery mechanisms

By automating repetitive follow-ups and lead qualification, the system reduces dependency on large telecalling teams while enabling massive outreach scalability.
